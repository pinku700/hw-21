                    <h1>Water resources</h1>
                    <p>Water resources are natural resources of water that are potentially useful
                    for humans, for example as a source of drinking water supply or irrigation
                    water. These resources can be either freshwater from natural sources,
                    or water produced artificially from other sources, such as from
                     reclaimed water (wastewater) or desalinated water (seawater).
                     97% of the water on Earth is salt water and only three percent
                     is fresh water; slightly over two-thirds of this is frozen
                     in glaciers and polar ice caps.</p>

                     <h1>Safe Water</h1>
                     <p>Safe drinking (potable) water is the water that can be delivered to the
                         user and is safe for drinking, food preparation, personal hygiene and
                        washing [3]. The water must meet the required (chemical, biological
                         and physical) quality standards at the point of supply to the users
                         [5]. Therefore, safe drinking water is a relative term, which 
                         depends on the standards and guidelines of a country; the standards
                          set for the different quality parameters are different. The
                          standard of WHO is not exactly the same as that of USA, Canada,
                           European Commission, Russia, India, South Africa, Ethiopia, and
                            so on.</p>

                     <h1>Drinking Water</h1>
                     <p>Contaminated water and poor sanitation are linked to transmission of
                         diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis A, typhoid 
                        and polio. Absent, inadequate, or inappropriately managed water and
                        sanitation services expose individuals to preventable health risks.
                        This is particularly the case in health care facilities where both
                         patients and staff are placed at additional risk of infection and
                         disease when water, sanitation and hygiene services are lacking.</p>
